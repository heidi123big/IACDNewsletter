			<td><p>Dear Dance Community,

					One of our long term goals for IACD has been for our membership to grow and 
			become more diverse. This summer I attended the Creative Dance Congress 
			(which I helped coordinate) as well as the Teacher Training course with Mary 
			Ann Brehm and Griff Goehring. I was so pleased with the great diversity of the 
			dancers. The younger generation was well represented as well as some men 
			and some international participants.Though the Teacher Training course was a 
			Mettler Studios event, four of the participants became IACD members. 
			<p>It is exciting to feel the momentum generated by the presence of the diverse groups,
			especially the younger ones who bring such vibrancy and new inspiration. 
			The importance of outreach has been evident in bringing new people to Creative
			Dance. Many of the younger dancers have come out of the wonderful 
			Hampshire College course; Group Improvisation: Introduction to Creative Dance
			which Griff Goehring has been teaching for nine years. We can all continue to 
			do our part by telling people about Mettler-based dance and inviting them to join 
			our ever widening circle of dance. </p> <img align="right" src="photos/congress2014_1.png">
			<p>On another note, we are saying goodbye to two of our Board members, Kyla 
			Ferguson and Juanita Lehman and wish them all the best in their future 
			endeavors. Much gratitude to Kyla for serving as our Secretary and to Juanita 
			who has been our Treasurer. We are excited to welcome Kathleen Moore who is
			joining our Board of Directors! Kathleen brings a deep involvement with Mettler-based Creative Dance and a desire to pass it on to others as her motivation for 
			being on the Board. </p>
			<p> We have also hired a professional bookkeeper, Kathy Ramert, to take over our 
			bookkeeping. Kathy is also a Quick Books expert and is working with Juanita to 
			make a smooth transition of these important financial tasks. </p>

			<p>Yours in dance, <br><br>

			<td><p><img align="right" src="photos/300x216_griff2.png" /> We did it. <br> For the 10th consecutive year the members and friends of IACD have successfully raised the funds to underwrite the course Group Improvisation: Introduction to Creative Dance at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. Total donations as of August 31st were $3590.00  Thanks to the dedication of our community a new generation of dancers is learning and practicing the principles of creative free movement expression developed by Barbara Mettler. </p>
 			<p>As part of this year&#8217;s appeal the Barbara Mettler Trust agreed to match your donations. That generosity seemed to inspire everyone to give a little more. In the past most contributions have fallen in the $25 - $50 range. In fact, there have been some years when our success has relied on one or two large gifts. This year, however, nine of you gave in the $200 - $500 range. (Last year there were 3 in that category.) That does not diminish the importance of donations of smaller amounts. A $5.00 gift shows as much commitment to this group effort as a $500 gift. We succeed when everyone participates to their best ability. </p>
			<p>It is my privilege to teach the course that IACD funds. I want to personally thank you all for continuing to support this work.  Watching younger dancers catch fire with excitement when they first experience Mettler-based creative dance is satisfying and inspiring. </p>

					<q><em>This was the best course I took all year.</em></q> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First year student &#8217;14.<br><br>

					<q><em>Barbara Mettler&#8217;s approach to dance is at first shocking and then irresistibly enticing.</em></q></span> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mount Holyoke Student &#8217;14 <br>

				Weather cooperated beautifully for Mettler Studios' weekend workshop on "Sound, Beat, and Movement" at the Windhover Center for the Performing Arts in Rockport, Massachusetts taught by Mary Ann Brehm and Nancy Lob.  Twenty dancers gathered at this retreat center near the ocean for dancing and overnight stay in rustic cottages.  The topic of the workshop was inspired, in part, from Mary Ann's study this year of Barbara Mettler's lessons in her 1978 Summer Course on the Time Element.  Here is a link to a video, Barbara Mettler Teaching Dance: Sound, Beat, and Movement that was shown at the workshop.  Mary Ann is going to be teaching a one day workshop on the same topic in December in Tucson.

				Joanna Cashman (OR) Relocated to beautiful Bend, OR. Where she is enjoying the abundance of natural beauty and outdoor recreation that Bend is notorious for. She co-founded a weekly conscious dance event, Pulse: The Alchemy of Movement, and she is teaching Chakra Dance, Integrative Brain Dance and the Radiant Health Yoga teacher training at the Central Oregon Community College. For more information about PULSE: The Alchemy of Movement visitwww.PulseBend.com . Dance improvisation continues to be one of her greatest joys. <br>
				Joannaâ€™s massage therapy work has become multi-disciplinary combining Eastern and Western approaches to healing body & mind. She is especially impressed by the effectiveness of treating acupoints with tuning forks and is learning more about vibrational medicine. She sends her love to all the Mettler dancers who have contributed to so many happy dancing memories. Blessings to All.

				Grounding <p>
 
				Never ending problems to solve take their toll. <br>
				Oak floor calls me into lazy rolling. <br>
				Soma softens, tension spills into what we have taken from the forest.<br>
				Mind releases the delusion of control<br>
				And surrender to the omniscient Creator triggers healing<br>
				Inspires creativity<br>
				Longing for buoyancy, fulfilled only after this ritual of dropping bones into supportive wood is complete.<br>
				The pendulum shifts<br>
				Heavy weight gives way to lightness of spirit and feet leave the earth.<br><br>

				This is one of my favorite drawings of those inspired by our weekly Creative Dance Portland group, led by Yael Schweitzer. After our group dance ended, I drew this image from memory...how it felt and how I imagined our shape appeared from the outside. <br>
				Dance is a source for my art in both imagery and in keeping my body loose and free to move and create. I notice a stark difference between the times when I am not dancing (at these times drawing can be a bit stilted)...and the times when I move regularly (the work flows out of me naturally with ease). I cherish this and I am truly grateful to have this group to share, trust and move with on a regular basis.
				In gratitude,  Alisa Looney
