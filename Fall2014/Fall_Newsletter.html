	<p>Hello and welcome! </p>

	<p>My name is Heidi Biggs and I&#39ve taken on the responsibilities of Newsletter Editor for the IACD. </p>

	<p>I was first exposed to Barbara Mettler&#39s work about 4 years ago at the Portland, OR pre-congress and I&#39ve been dancing ever since! As for the writer/editor side of things: I studied English Literature at the University of Washington and am a weirdo who always wants to help people edit their papers, even though I'm not in school anymore. Now I get to help the IACD! It's a win/win.  </p>

	<p>This Fall issue seems to reflect a general trend in the IACD toward change and outreach. The articles, as well as their new digital format, cohere to tell the story of an organization stretching its boundaries and exploring new territory--seeking new avenues of growth while honoring its roots.</p> <p>As we move forward, this publication requires your support! This newsletter needs content, and everyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute! All voices and stories are desired and valued. Please, PLEASE! Do not shy away from sharing your Creative Dance experiences in the newsletter. First and foremost, this is a publication about, by, and for our lovely community, The IACD! </p>

	<p> I admire the work you all do to <q>fulfill the basic human need for free movement expression.</q></p>

	<p> Enjoy your reading and keep on dancing! </p>
	<p>
	-Heidi

	<div class="artcontain"><span class="artheader">A Transformative Dance Experience at the

19th Annual Creative Dance Congress </span></div>
<span class="author"> By Sarah Boone  </span>


<p>As a first time participant at a Creative Dance Congress, I gained a deeper appreciation for improvisational dance and connected with my own creativity. The group of dancers were all women between 20 and 84 years old. Nothing can express the wonderful bond that was formed between us over the six days we danced together. It was really special to be able to dance with my mom and get to experience this art form that is so close to her heart. There was also another mother-daughter pair in the Congress who danced together. <img align="right" style="padding-top:10px;" src="photos/congress2014_2.png" /> </p>

 <p> It was great dancing with dancers who have experience with creative dance as well as other first time participants. Everyone seemed ready to dive into the creative pool and immerse themselves in improvisation. It was an honor to be guided through each session by such wonderful teachers. As a technically trained dancer, I was able to let go of technicality and connect with my kinesthetic sense through new ideas, playfulness, imagery, sound, sensation, new awareness, and creative pauses. It was amazing what came out of creative pauses--various tempos, different levels, everyone connecting through waves of intuition and going on dancing journeys together through the space. </p>

 <p>We danced in a beautiful ballroom at the Scottish Rite Center which had a tall ceiling, wooden chairs surrounding the ballroom&#39;s wood floor, and a doorway leading outdoors into a grassy courtyard. Having this large space to dance in was a treat and I think it influenced our dancing in a profound way. </p>
<img style="padding-right:10px;" align="left" src="photos/congress2014_1.png" />
<p>Helen Horigan led Group Movement Expression which taught me to move with a group and how to sense other bodies moving through space around me. I gained a new awareness, and began to feel more and more comfortable dancing with others. </p>

<p>My mom, Jean Tobias, taught Force of Nature, which was a great lesson on how to make forceful and forceless movements and how to connect to a deep environmental awareness. Each group danced an element; earth, water, fire and air. All of the elements came together in a group dance and we all had to find ways to coexist with one another. </p>

<p>Yael Schweitzer taught Dancing from the Heart, which was a wonderful experience and perhaps my favorite dance session. During this session, I was able to dance from the heart, express emotion, and feel grounded and strong in my dancing. I began to move with intent and ease and I connected with everyone around me in a way that came naturally, sometimes subconsciously. Everyone was unified in one idea so moving together became effortless. I discovered the healing power of dance through ideas such as supporting yourself, expressing love and compassion from the heart, and being happy and healthy. </p>
<img align="right" src="photos/congress2014_4.png" />
<p>Griff Goehring led us in a session about Space. This session expanded my awareness 
of how we become shapes in space both individually, and as a group body. I have had a lot of 
practice in spatial awareness individually, but this session taught me something new and exciting about making shapes in space as a whole group of dancers. When we split up into two groups and each did a group dance, it was amazing. From beginning to end, the group moved together very organically while making beautiful shapes. As a technically trained dancer, always having to concentrate on the placement of my body in space, it was very satisfying to move from one spot in the room to the next without having to remember any steps, allowing my movement feeling to lead me. </p>

<p/>On the last day of the workshop, Sue Pfaffl led us in an outdoor dance at the scenic 
and beautiful Santa Fe University of Art and Design. We danced in trees and around sculptures letting the magic of nature take our dancing to new heights. One of the exercises 
was partnered--one person led the other around while they had their eyes closed. This 
was fun and challenging for me. To not be able to see, but to trust in your partner while they are 
walking next to you makes you, really aware of your steps, your center of gravity, and how 
your body moves in nature. </p>

<p> Dancing in nature with everyone and getting to experience the 
outdoors was so special, I felt very lucky to be there. This was a great way to end the 
Congress, in nature, in gratitude, in love, and unified in dance. </p>

<div class="artcontain"><span class="artheader">Creative Dance in Vietnam: Evolve Dance Inc.'s Powerful Outreach </span></div>
<span class="author">By Karenne Koo </span>
<p>
In August 2013, a unique opportunity to partner with Pacific Links Foundation (PALS) and 
Hagar International Vietnam (Hagar Vietnam), brought Evolve Dance Inc. to Vietnam to conduct creative dance residencies for survivors of abuse and trafficking and their affiliated personnel/staff (who assist with the rehabilitation and reintegration process). Evolve Dancing Communities: Vietnam 2013 was Phase I of a two-part pilot project. It introduced the concept of creative dance as a powerful complement to existing programs that aim to help survivors heal from trauma. </p>
<p>In May 2014, we followed up with Evolve Dancing Communities: Vietnam 2014 Phase II. It began with an expanded, 5-day dance intensive at Hagar Vietnam for the Hagar Vietnam clients and staff as well as affiliated personnel from other local NGO&#39;s. 
Facilitated by Karenne Koo, and utilizing Mettler-based creative dance methodologies, the workshops focused on individual and group body expressions while exploring concepts such as group dynamics, leadership roles, self-confidence and celebration of personal creativity. </p>

<p>We began each class with the basic body scan, to bring awareness into each body part as a way of reconnecting the individual with her own body. The workshops were structured to explore specific elements in depth every day with each succeeding day building on the previous day. Every dancer was open to this wholly new experience of creative, improvisational dance, and each class was truly a time of discovery for us as we danced together. 
At the end of the week, participants told me that they had never experienced a time where they felt so free to express themselves through movement, and that this unique Mettler-based form of dance is accessible and powerful. They want to try and incorporate creative movement in their work with trauma survivors. I left with many hugs, tears and promises to stay in touch in my ongoing commitment to help them in their valuable work. </p>
<img style="padding-right:10px;" align="left" src="photos/hagar_vietnam.jpg" />
<p>Next on our journey, on May 31, Evolve Dance artists Annie Tucker, Julie Johnson and Karenne Koo boarded the 8-hour overnight train from Hanoi to Lao Cai. Located at the border of Vietnam and China and first opened in May 2010, the Lao Cai Compassion House has assisted more than 50 trafficking survivors, 95% of whom are young women from various ethnic minorities between the ages of 13 and 22. Operated by PALS, the shelter provides safe housing for the women as well as opportunities to attend traditional academic schooling or vocational training as part of reintegration efforts. </p>
<p>During the week of June 2, 2014, we held 2 hour classes every morning. We structured our lesson plan on creative movement explorations, building upon some of the concepts we worked on during the previous year. We started each class with the Name Dance, where we associated and shared movement with our names. We encouraged dancers to think and move creatively as individuals, but with awareness of the whole group. Each day, we instructed the girls to experiment with a variety of movement concepts on an individual basis first, to learn and understand how their own bodies solved movement puzzles. Then we progressed to partnering and small group studies. The last portion of class was always devoted to whole group work. </p>
<p>Some of the studies we did included: Body Expressions (Body Scans, Individual Body Parts, Body Shapes, Group Sculpture Dance); Quality of Movement (Walking Study, Types of Movement in the form of stretching, twisting, flopping, etc., Changing Levels Dance); Activity/Passivity (Leading with Gentle Touch, Leading without Touch, 1 active force moving group); Using Everyday Objects as Instrument (Individual dances with body part limitation and with objects in silence and with sound, Dancers Follow Music, Music Follow Dancer); Dancing 
the Environment (Dancers fully utilizing dance space, dancers drawing an environment 
and expressing with movement). We also inserted Unison Line Dances and Circle Dances throughout the week. </p>
<img align="right" src="photos/pals_vietnam.png" />
<p>Because we were working with young women who have survived very traumatic experiences, we were hypersensitive to issues of personal space and touch. We watched carefully to see if any of the movement exercises were making dancers uncomfortable. However, the dancers were open and eager to try everything we planned--they danced with the joy of discovery. We saw the dancers incorporating the different movement lessons (i.e., using different levels and shapes) in their compositions. We saw support and cooperation amongst dancers. Most of all, we heard unrestrained laughter. </p>
<p>After our week at the Compassion House, it was expressed to us that these girls had never had the experience of &#39;outsiders&#39; spending so much time and focus on them without judgment. For us, it was a transformative experience to spend a week with these young women who have incredible inner strength. We witnessed the resilience of the human 
spirit in these girls and we felt honored to dance with them and share a very special moment in time with them. </p>
<p>The exciting epilogue to the Evolve Dancing Communities: Vietnam Project is the collaboration between Evolve Dance and Mettler Studios. This past July, two staff members from PALS and one staff member from Hagar Vietnam were able to travel to Tucson, AZ to attend the Mettler Creative Dance Teacher Training Workshop. Taught by Mary Ann Brehm and Griff Goerhing, the workshop gave all of us valuable insights and practical applications to put into our individual &#39;creative dance tool bags.&#39; Evolve Dance&#39;s partnership with Mettler Studios is part of the effort to encourage sustainable dance programming with PALS and with Hagar Vietnam. Online mentoring will assist PALS and Hagar Vietnam in continuing and building the dance program which we started with them in 2013. </p>

		 <div class="artcontain"> <span class="artheader">Dance Improvisation Workshop and Teacher Training, July 2014 </span></div>
			<span class="author"> By Melissa Sabatini  </span>
			
					<p>The Dance Improvisation Workshop and Teacher Training, held in Tucson, Arizona this past July, was the highlight of my summer.  The training, taught by the experienced duo of Mary Ann Brehm and Griff Goehring, was well planned, fun, informative, and transformative.  Workshop participants represented many areas of the U.S. as well as places abroad, including Vietnam, Japan, and the Philippines. The dancer&#8217;s backgrounds were as interesting and varied as the geographic locations from which they travelled.</p> <img align="left" style="padding-right: 10px" src="photos/teachertrain_1.png">

					<p>With a total count of 19, including our spirited leaders (Mary Ann and Griff), we danced for five consecutive, wonderful days.  Each day offered an introduction and exploration of the basic elements of Barbara&#8217;s approach to dance: force, time, and space.  Through <q>organic form</q> and <q>directed exercises</q> we explored the <q>roots of human movement expression</q> (Brehm 2014) and cultivated awareness of our own kinesthetic sense.  With our kinesthetic senses employed we moved in relation to other dancers.  In relation with others, we learned about the importance of activity and passivity and its relevance to building satisfying group forms. </p>


					<p>Here were some of the high points of the training for me: </p>
						<ul>

							<li>Visiting the Tucson Creative Dance Center for the first time was more exciting than I had initially anticipated.  Entering the simple but beautiful structure, seeing Barbara&#8217;s pictures on the walls, and feeling the smooth, round dance floor under my feet where so many others had gone before me in the work was humbling and anchoring to me. </li>
							
							<li>The note taking sessions and verbal discussions each day helped me further understand the work and how to offer it to others.</li>
							<li>Watching and hearing video clips of Barbara Mettler in action--super cool!</li>
							<li>Purchasing Barbara Mettler&#8217;s books for 50% off and paying no shipping costs (if you were an IACD member).  You can&#8217;t beat that deal!</li>
							<li>Meeting and dancing with other Mettler-based dancers, some of whom I'd heard and read about and seen pictures of in the newsletter, in addition to my home group (Creative Dance Providence) was affirming. </li>
						</ul>
						<img align="right" src="photos/teachertrain_4.png">

					<p>I am very glad I attended the workshop/training. I would also like to acknowledge the great job the facilitators did not only with the instruction but also helping logistically with all of the other things that it took to make it to the training.  </p>

					<p>In closing, if you have been thinking about going to a workshop or training for a while and just haven&#8217;t done it yet, consider this a strong recommendation to do so.  Everyone benefits: you, the IACD, and the community at large, because <q>dance fulfills a basic human need for artistic creation through movement.</q> (Brehm, 2014)  </p>
					

						<div class="artcontain"> <span class="artheader">The Charming Lure of the Emerald City</span></div>
						<span class="author"> By Sue Biggs  </span>						
							<p>The  charming lure of the Emerald City, the thrill of dancing Mettler once again with my daughter,  Heidi, and the opportunity to work with the inspired dancer/teacher, Griff Goehring, brought me from chilly, muddy Alaska to the heart of sunny, downtown Seattle.
							The 2-day dance workshop held this past May, was situated in the delightful and eventful Seattle Center.  Amidst the  beauty of spring flowers and budding trees, there was a hubbub of tourists, street musicians, venders of delectable foods, and an intriguing Japanese cultural event with much color and pageantry!  </p>
						
							<p>Shedding my winter coat, I joined the other dancers as we wound our way to the upper level of the Seattle Center&#8217;s Armory to the dance studio:  a dark, cool dance space with a worn wood floor and gentle sunbeams flowing through old, wood-framed windows...a quiet and pleasant contrast to the bright, busy outdoors.   The music of a street minstrel playing James Taylor tunes floated in on the warm air.  </p>
							<img align="right" style="padding-right: 10px" src="photos/seattle_2.png">

							 <p>We had come from the corners of America:  Alaska, New Hampshire, and the Washington coast.  That first day we were a group of experienced Mettler dancers.   Though one goal of this workshop was to introduce new people to Mettler-based movement, it was truly a gift to have this time to dance with this amazing group of dancers.  Together we eagerly devoured the directed studies and group dances;  the organic evolution of moves and sounds were delightful, moving, and extremely satisfying.  </p>
							
							<p>Though Seattle seemed a hard nut to crack when trying to introduce and advertise a new, foreign movement approach to a very large, arts-saturated community, the second day brought a fresh face to the group.  A new dancer meant returning to the basics.  I found a deep appreciation for the review; here lay the building blocks of all dance experiences and movement formations: relaxation and focus.  It was an opportunity to watch, once again, the pedagogy of starting new dancers.  It was a day of hard, deep, and joyous work.  We all left the studio exhausted but with a great feeling of accomplishment and a sense we had added something unique and positive to the spirit of Seattle. </p>




			<div class="textcontain"><span class="header"> Letter from the Board </span></div>
	
	
		<p>Dear Dance Community, </p>

					<p>One of our long term goals for IACD has been for our membership to grow and 
			become more diverse. This summer I attended the Creative Dance Congress 
			(which I helped coordinate) as well as the Teacher Training course with Mary 
			Ann Brehm and Griff Goehring. I was so pleased with the great diversity of the 
			dancers. The younger generation was well represented as well as some men 
			and some international participants. Though the Teacher Training Course was a 
			Mettler Studios event, four of the participants became IACD members. </p>
			<p>It is exciting to feel the momentum generated by the presence of the diverse groups,
			especially the younger ones who bring such vibrancy and new inspiration. 
			The importance of outreach has been evident in bringing new people to Creative
			Dance. Many of the younger dancers have come out of the wonderful 
			Hampshire College course, Group Improvisation: Introduction to Creative Dance
			which Griff Goehring has been teaching for nine years. We can all continue to 
			do our part by telling people about Mettler-based dance and inviting them to join 
			our ever widening circle of dance. </p> 
			<p>On another note, we are saying goodbye to two of our board members, Kyla 
			Ferguson and Juanita Lehman and wish them all the best in their future 
			endeavors. Much gratitude to Kyla for serving as our secretary and to Juanita 
			who has been our treasurer. We are excited to welcome Kathleen Moore who is
			joining our Board of Directors! Kathleen brings a deep involvement with Mettler-based Creative Dance and a desire to pass it on to others as her motivation for 
			being on the Board. </p>
			<p> We have also hired a professional bookkeeper, Kathy Ramert, to take over our 
			bookkeeping. Kathy is also a Quick Books expert and is working with Juanita to 
			make a smooth transition of these important financial tasks. </p>

			<p>Yours in dance, <br><br>

			Jean Tobias<br>

			IACD president</p>
		
		
			<div class="artcontain"><span class="artheader">Hampshire College Class: Onward! </span></div>
			<span class="author"> By Griff Goehring</span>
		
			<p><img align="right" src="photos/300x216_griff2.png" /> <p>We did it. </p> For the 10th consecutive year the members and friends of IACD have successfully raised the funds to underwrite the course Group Improvisation: Introduction to Creative Dance at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. Total donations as of August 31st were $3590.00  Thanks to the dedication of our community, a new generation of dancers is learning and practicing the principles of creative free movement expression developed by Barbara Mettler. </p>
	 			<p>As part of this year&#8217;s appeal the Barbara Mettler Trust agreed to match your donations. That generosity seemed to inspire everyone to give a little more. In the past most contributions have fallen in the $25 - $50 range. In fact, there have been some years when our success has relied on one or two large gifts. This year, however, nine of you gave in the $200 - $500 range. (Last year there were 3 in that category.) That does not diminish the importance of donations of smaller amounts. A $5.00 gift shows as much commitment to this group effort as a $500 gift. We succeed when everyone participates to their best ability. </p>
			<p>It is my privilege to teach the course that IACD funds. I want to personally thank you all for continuing to support this work.  Watching younger dancers catch fire with excitement when they first experience Mettler-based creative dance is satisfying and inspiring. </p> 

				<img align="left" style="padding: 5px" src="photos/300x300_griff1.png" >
				<p>Here are some of my favorite quotes from student papers:</p>		
				<p>
	 				<q><em>I feel like I am a plant and I just want to grow and grow.</em></q> 
	 				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second year student &#8217;11<br><br>

					<q><em>This was the best course I took all year.</em></q> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First year student &#8217;14.<br><br>

					<q><em>Barbara Mettler&#8217;s approach to dance is at first shocking and then irresistibly enticing.</em></q></span> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mount Holyoke Student &#8217;14 <br>
				</p>	
	
			<p>Thanks to IACD and the Barbara Mettler Trust we will keep shocking, enticing and inspiring students for more years to come. <br> <br>

				lava rock's throw away from the oceanside. Nearby is Kehena Beach, a unique black sand beach where 

				dolphins occasionally swim. Within a short driving distance are warm ponds, tide pools and several 

				parks, making Kalani an ideal place to stay while exploring everything the Big Island has to offer."</p>

				<p>Several attendees from the wildly successful 2005 Creative Dance Congress expressed interest in 

				returning to the Kalani on this, the 10 year anniversary. Dates for the 2015 Creative Dance Congress are 

				June 22 through 26 and, due to the costs of air fare and lodging, the fee for the Congress will be only 

				$75. Rooms have been reserved for 6 nights, 6/21 through 6/26. </p>

				<p> <strong> Room rates are as follows: </strong> </p>

				<img align="right" src="photos/sunset.jpg">

				<p>Lodge rooms</p>

				<p>$99 per person per night / double room with shared bat <br>

				$125 per person per night / double room with a private bath<br>

				$135 per person per night / single room with shared bath<br>

				$175 per person per night / single room with private bath</p>

				<p>Bungalows</p>

				<p>$135 per person per night / double room with private bath <br>

				$195 per person per night / single room with private bath</p>

				<p>Pools and hot tubs are included and available for all. Room rates include all three daily meals, and

				reports are that the food is excellent! Kalani chefs typically include abundant local tropical fruits and 

				vegetables and freshly caught fish on the menu.

				Spouses, and family members are welcome to stay at the Kalani at the same reduced rates offered to 

				Dance Congress attendees. However, non-members will be charged a registration fee of $30. Extended 

				stays are possible at the same room rates, depending on room availability. </p>

				<p>For more information, 

				contact Meg Quinn at mgqnn@aol.com, or Sue Pfaffl at csuepfaffl@gmail.com. </p>

				<p>We are looking for a few volunteers to help coordinate the event, and the Congress fee is waived for 

				coordinators. If you can assist, please contact Meg Quinn at mgqnn@aol.com. </p>

				<p> See you at the Kalani in 2015!! </p>

				<p>Weather cooperated beautifully for Mettler Studios' weekend workshop on "Sound, Beat, and Movement" at the Windhover Center for the Performing Arts in Rockport, Massachusetts taught by Mary Ann Brehm and Nancy Lob.  <p> Twenty dancers gathered at this retreat center near the ocean for dancing and overnight stay in rustic cottages.  The topic of the workshop was inspired, in part, from Mary Ann's study this year of Barbara Mettler's lessons in her 1978 Summer Course on the Time Element. </p> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r06-OBRvYSM">Here is a link to the video <em> Barbara Mettler Teaching Dance: Sound, Beat, and Movement</em>,that was shown at the workshop.</a> Mary Ann is going to be teaching a one day workshop on the same topic in December in Tucson. </p>

	<div style="background-color: #ECECEC"> <p><strong> Grounding </strong> </p>
 
				<p>Never ending problems to solve take their toll. <br>
				Oak floor calls me into lazy rolling. <br>
				Soma softens, tension spills into what we have taken from the forest.<br>
				Mind releases the delusion of control<br>
				And surrender to the omniscient Creator triggers healing<br>
				Inspires creativity<br>
				Longing for buoyancy, fulfilled only after this ritual of dropping bones into supportive wood is complete.<br>
				The pendulum shifts<br>
				Heavy weight gives way to lightness of spirit and feet leave the earth.<br><br>

		This is one of my favorite drawings of those inspired by our weekly Creative Dance Portland group, led by Yael Schweitzer. After our group dance ended, I drew this image from memory...how it felt and how I imagined our shape appeared from the outside. <br>
		Dance is a source for my art in both imagery and in keeping my body loose and free to move and create. I notice a stark difference between the times when I am not dancing (at these times drawing can be a bit stilted)...and the times when I move regularly (the work flows out of me naturally with ease). I cherish this and I am truly grateful to have this group to share, trust and move with on a regular basis.
